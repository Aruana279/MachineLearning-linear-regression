# ANALYSIS

## What is the mean effective branching factor for each of the 6 heuristics? 

The mean effective branching factor is the following for each of the 6 heuristics:
    1: 
    2:
    3:
    4:
    5:
    6:

## How do the 5 heuristics vary in effectiveness? 

## How much gain is there to using any heuristic (#1 vs. #2)? 

## Is #5 noticeably more effective than the other heuristics? 

## For heuristic #6: how does its solution quality compare with #5? Is it performing noticeably worse? How much more efficient is it?

## How large of a map can you solve in 30 seconds using Heuristic 5? 
Using heuristic 5, the algorithm can solve a map that is 

## How much memory is needed? Perform a “back of the envelope” calculation for how large a board you could solve with 16 GB of memory using each of the 6 heuristics (you can assume the board is square for this analysis). 


## How large of a board could you solve with Heuristic 6 and 16GB of memory? 


## How long would it take to solve that board? 

## How much memory would you need for a problem that requires 24 hours to solve with Heuristic 5? With heuristic 6?
